===
## Features:
  - Basic types (integers, reals, strings, lists)
  - O(1) time list/array lookup
  - Conditionals, recursion, & iteration
  - Functions as first-class objects (nested functions)
  - Anonymous/lambda functions
  - Most of the standard C operators (+, -, /, and so on)

## What's Missing:
  - Any form of garbage collection
  - Objects 
  - Importing from other files
  - I/O, network, and other useful typical APIs..
  - A reason you should be using this

### To build:
    make

### To run some of the demos
    ./presto demos/arrays.p
    and so on..
